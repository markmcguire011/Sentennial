## What Makes a Wonder?

Human history has been filled with an incredible volume of construction, so what makes any one structure magnificent? Is it a mix of complex engineering and incredible resilience, or is it the scale and devotion of enormous amounts of labor and resources? Could it be the utility of the building? And you can’t forget about cultural and religious connotations. Any number of things could contribute to how such a construction is perceived. 

The task of really narrowing down the countless brilliant buildings that we have today to a shortlist of only the best of the best is a daunting task (it’s been done, but most attempts really don’t take into account some spectacular feats of modern engineering. Noticeably lacking are newer buildings which may be less culturally significant but no less impressive). For ancient Greek and Roman writers though, it was a little less challenging; travel restraints, lack of information, and an absence of well-oiled and consumer-oriented tourism machines limited the available options. 

The writers deemed 7 monuments (The ever present number 7 in historical antiquity, biblical retellings, and all manners of different contexts is also an extremely interesting topic in and of itself. I may write something in the future about the phenomena but for now just know that the Greeks thought that 7 was a perfect number.) fit for the title of world wonder.

The most intriguing of which (for me at least) being the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. A truly incredible work of engineering for its time, it excites both my inner historian and love for complex systems. Just the name itself conveys a certain sense of awe or mysticism, of a lost oasis, a certain - fountain of youth - connotation. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. I love it. It makes me want to learn more about its intricacies, its mysteries.
