Human history has been filled with an incredible volume of construction, so what makes any one structure magnificent? Is it a mix of complex engineering and incredible resilience, or is it the scale and devotion of enormous amounts of labor and resources? Could it be the utility of the building? And you can’t forget about cultural and religious connotations. Any number of things could contribute to how such a construction is perceived. 

The task of really narrowing down the countless brilliant buildings that we have today to a shortlist of only the best of the best is a daunting task[^01].

The writers deemed 7 monuments[^02] fit for the title of world wonder.

The most intriguing of which (for me at least) being the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. A truly incredible work of engineering for its time, it excites both my inner historian and love for complex systems. Just the name itself conveys a certain sense of awe or mysticism, of a lost oasis, a certain - fountain of youth - connotation. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. I love it. It makes me want to learn more about its intricacies, its mysteries.
