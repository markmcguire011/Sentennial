## The Great Russian Doll of the World

I remember way back in middle school, in a science class, I learned of the concept of a 'closed system'. Something where matter couldn't get in or out, and you would be studying one specific interaction or reaction.
But in reality, is anything really a closed system, no. I learned quickly after in my high school chemistry and physics classes that actually, energy is just *lost* to the environment all the time. Sure it's not
very much, but it refutes the idea of real, pure, closed systems.

First of all, that's crazy. We have houses, buildings, boxes, all these containers and separators, and in reality, these things aren't the steadfast barriers we imagine them to be. A truly closed system just *does not
exist*.

We have systems, upon systems, upon systems all interacting in extremely intricate ways all the time, all around use, but in reality, it's just **one big thing**. Yep, the Universe[^1].

And honestly, that can be comforting in a "we're all connected" type philosophy, but I want to take this idea somewhere else.

## Humans!

I have so much love and affection for my fellow man, I really do, but what I love even more, the systems that humans create! Now *obviously* we have some pretty great natural systems that form the basis of life as we know it,
but isn't it amazing how much humanity has built upon this foundation?

There is just an enormous amount of stuff, and specifically, systems, that we have created. It's mind boggling as well to think that any one person may never understand the full breadth, depth, and power of these creations. Markets,
for example, extremely mystifying, government, very intriguing, computers and networks, extremely cool. There is just really no end.

For me, this is a very singular passion that has endless avenues of exploration. Learning about the randomness 3,000 years ago is just as fun as the extremely important geo-political struggles of today.

## Mastery

So where is this leading, what do I have to say? Good question: being good at something.

There is so much depth to the world, that really what any of us should strive for, is devoting yourself to the system that gives us the most joy. Whatever that thing is, we, as humans, are capable of extraordinary things.
Seeing the impact we can have on the world—a system, an institution—a system, ourselves—a system, and other people (also a system) is all a matter of perspective and willingness to try.

Whatever system you choose to flourish in, bloom like the brightest and most vibrant flower you've ever known! First of all, you can do it, second of all, why not, and third of all, that's what life is all about.

[^1]: "But if the universe is always expanding..." Wow that's exactly what I thought! What is the interaction between the non-universe and expanding-universe? I don't know, and I'm in the process of googling...
